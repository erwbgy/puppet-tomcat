id and response time rather than hyphens for logical hostname and remote user

with multiple instances.

0.6.2:

* Give context to the thread dump by using top to show what the threads
running as the current user are doing.

* Fix reference to undefined product_dir variable and ensure that thread_dump
and jolokia changes are made even if the product tarball has already been
unpacked.

0.6.0:

* Added a script to easily do a thread dump using jstack.

* Allow dependencies on other Runit services that must all be up before the

* Make the file store location of the Tomcat tarball and Jolokia war file
configurable.

0.5.0:

* Added a Runit check script that determines if the instance is up by using
lsof to check that it is listening on a specified host (bind_address) and port
(check_port).

* Added default templates for server.xml to listen on the specified
bind_address and logging.properties to use the specified logdir.

* Allow the localhost address to be specified which is required when running
multiple instances on the same host.

0.4.0:

* Start in the product directory so relative paths work as expected

* Enable CPU affinity to be set to only run processes on specific CPU cores

* Fixed bug where setting the version at the instance level still resulted in
an error that the version was not set

* Removed bind_address and replaced it with a config hash to set variables
that are used when templates are processed.

0.2.1:

* Ensure file or template parent directories exist before delivering files
