0.5.0:

* Added a Runit check script that determines if the instance is up by using
lsof to check that it is listening on a specified host (bind_address) and port
(check_port).

* Added default templates for server.xml to listen on the specified
bind_address and logging.properties to use the specified logdir.

0.4.0:

* Start in the product directory so relative paths work as expected

* Enable CPU affinity to be set to only run processes on specific CPU cores

* Fixed bug where setting the version at the instance level still resulted in
an error that the version was not set

0.3.0:

* Removed bind_address and replaced it with a config hash to set variables
that are used when templates are processed.

0.2.1:

* Ensure file or template parent directories exist before delivering files
