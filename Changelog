0.3.0:

* Removed bind_address and replaced it with a config hash to set variables
that are used when templates are processed.

* Start in the product directory so relative paths work as expected

* Enable CPU affinity to be set to only run processes on specific CPU cores

* Fixed bug where setting the version at the instance level still resulted in
an error that the version was not set.

0.2.1:

* Ensure file or template parent directories exist before delivering files
